1. Execute `npm run build` command in the terminal to start the build process
2. Carefully analyze the terminal output for any errors, warnings, or build failures
3. If errors are detected:
   a. Examine each error message to understand the root cause
   b. Fix the identified issues in the relevant files
   c. Save all changes
   d. Re-run `npm run build` to verify fixes
   e. Repeat this process until the build completes successfully
4. If warnings appear (but build succeeds):
   a. Evaluate the severity and impact of each warning
   b. Address critical warnings that might affect application performance/functionality
   c. Document any warnings that are intentionally left unresolved
5. When the build completes without errors:
   a. Verify the build artifacts in the output directory
   b. Confirm the build size and optimization metrics are acceptable
   c. Report successful build completion with relevant statistics
6. If build times are excessive:
   a. Consider analyzing build performance bottlenecks
   b. Suggest potential optimization strategies
